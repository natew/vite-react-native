### Is this production ready?

All features for 1.0 now work and half are well tested. We've been using it
for [tamagui.dev](https://tamagui.dev) for 6 months or so. Native we'd like to think is stable summer 2025.

### What's breaking?

There's a few things that we need to improve:

- Hot reloading easily breaks.
- Package compatibility - you'll likey need to use the [deps options](/docs/configuration#deps) as we fix issues.

See the [Status documentation](/docs/status) for more on the general stability of the high level API surfaces.

### How does it compare to Expo Router / Metro?

One started as [vxrn](https://vxrn.dev), a library we made that let Vite serve React Native. To test if it worked well, we ported Expo Router and generally got it working. We didn't implement DOM components and a couple other features, but we did add things like [render modes](/docs/routing-modes), [loaders](/docs/routing-loader), [middlewares](/docs/routing-middlewarewares), and [other things](/docs/features).

We added a CLI that serves and builds web, iOS and Android, and all the web features build to a production [Hono](https://hono.dev) server.

### Why Vite?

It feels light and simple, runs fast and is easy to customize. It has many web features that are all done well, relative to other bundlers, and the Vite types, documentation, type-documentation, RFC process, and commitment to community are all "god-tier".

### Will you support RSC?

We benefit from a lot of complexity focus on server-rendering without RSC, and with [a smart data library](https://zero.rocicorp.dev) you can get many of the same features with better end-user performance and simpler code.

We're open to a limited form of RSC that keeps things simple.

### What's the npm package?

It's `one`, thanks to Dan Maier.
