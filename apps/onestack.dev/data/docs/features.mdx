See the [Status document](/docs/status) for the status of features.

## Vite

The One Vite Plugin automates away much of the setup & boilerplate required for cross-platform React Native & web development.

Out of the box, the One Vite plugin does the following:

- Sets up a [file system router](/docs/routing) in the `./app` folder
- Generates [types for routes](/docs/routing#types) and updates them when routes change
- Enables [loaders](/docs/routing-loader) and tree shakes them out on client. Using the amazing [babel-dead-code-elimination](https://github.com/pcattori/babel-dead-code-elimination) module
- Enables the [`deps` option](/docs/configuration#deps) that allows for easy node_module patching
- Swaps between React 18 for native and React 19 for web
- Adds [vite-tsconfig-paths](https://github.com/aleclarson/vite-tsconfig-paths) plugin, unless it detects you've added it already
- Loads `.env` file into `process.env` before running anything using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)
- Adds a well-configured `tsconfig.json` if it doesn't exist
- Configures native to resolve "react-native" export field in package.json
- Configures platform-specific extensions `web|native|ios|android` for extensions `ts|tsx|js|mjs`, eg `.ios.ts`
- Adds a ssr-css plugin that enables perfect dev-mode CSS on first load, matching production
- Configures a wide variety of optimizeDeps presets for React Native library compatibility
- Patches a large number of known-bad node_modules to work with Vite
- Ensures optimized deps across all routes are found before first load, avoiding hard reloads and slow loads in development mode

## Universal

- Uses [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) routing and truly native layouts
- Adds [loaders](/docs/routing-loader) that work on native and web
- Adds a [Link](/docs/components-Link) component for navigation
- Adds a wide variety of hooks for routing
- Adds [`react-native-safe-area-context`](https://github.com/th3rdwave/react-native-safe-area-context) and exports [SafeAreaView](/docs/components-SafeAreaView)

## Native

- Implements a custom bundle output with React Native compatible commonjs
- Implements custom hot reloading that works with commonjs
- Implements a custom bridge to React Native for debug logging
- Implements logic to support importing assets, like images

## Web

- Adds `serve` command that sets up a [Hono](https://hono.dev/) server for production
- Implements SPA, SSG, and SSR style routing on a [per-page and global basis](/docs/routing-modes)
- Server rendering - find JS and CSS for all nested routes and layouts and hoists it to header to avoid waterfalls and flickering
- Automatically preloads next page JS when hovering a link or navigating to a new route, including loaders
  - Doesn't require up-front route map so no scaling cost
- Automatically handles scroll restoration and [allows configuration](/docs/components-ScrollBehavior)
- Adds an easy [`redirects` option](/docs/configuration)
- Adds [`generateStaticParams` export](/docs/routing-exports#generatestaticparams) for SSG and SSR routes
- Implements [API routes](/docs/routing-modes#api)
- Adds a [page loading progress bar](/docs/components-LoadProgressBar)
- Swaps `query-string` and `url-parse` libraries to save ~20Kb
- Adds a [Redirect component](/docs/components-Redirect) 

## Extras

- Exports a variety of [helpful utility functions](/docs/helpers-utility-functions)
- Analyze your web client-side bundle with `VXRN_ANALYZE_BUNDLE=1`
- Guide for [MDX support](/docs/guides-mdx)
- Guide for [light and dark mode](/docs/guides-dark-mode)
