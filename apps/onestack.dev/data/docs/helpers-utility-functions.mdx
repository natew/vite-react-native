All functions listed below are exported directly by `one`.

### redirect

A function that takes two arguments: a string `path`, and a number `status`.

```tsx
import { redirect } from 'one'

export function redirectToLogin() {
  return redirect('/login')
}
```

It accepts relative paths by using the [`getURL`](#getURL) helper internally.

On the server (including in loaders) it returns a `Response.redirect` object. On the client it calls `router.navigate` and returns void.

### getURL

A function that takes no arguments and returns a string of the current URL of the running application on client or server.

For example, in dev-mode by default this would be a string of `http://127.0.0.1:8081`. In non-development environments you will need to set `process.env.ONE_SERVER_URL` to your production URL with no trailing `/`.

### isResponse

One uses `Request`/`Response` type objects for API routes, but for some environments doing an `instanceof Response` can fail, `isResponse` takes any value and returns true if it is a Response-like object. Useful for API utility functions.

### href

A simple function allows for creating typed route strings. It's a type-level only check, at runtime it only validates that it is a string.

```tsx
import { href } from 'one'

const postPageLink = href(`/post/hello-world`) // will type error if invalid Href
```
