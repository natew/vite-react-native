title: one serve
---

Serve your web apps for production with `one serve`, after you've successfully run `one build`.

It takes the following arguments:

```bash
--host          # string, set the hostname to bind to
--port          # string, set the port to bind to
--platform      # node | vercel, instructs Hono server to use adapter
--compress      # boolean, enable gzip compression, defaults to true
```

One comes with a serve command that is powered by [Hono](https://hono.dev).

If you are only using SPA and SSG routes and aren't using loaders, you don't need to use `one serve` if you don't want to - you can statically serve the results of `dist/client` using any server you'd like.
