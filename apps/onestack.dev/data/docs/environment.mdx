This page covers anything One does during development and in production that modifies your environment.

### Variables

#### Loading .env files and process.env

One handles environment variables for you in a few ways.

First, it handles loading `.env` files during development and in production. In order to ease compatibility with ESM and CJS, One makes your loaded environment variables (from `.env` and from `process.env`) automatically be defined onto both `import.meta.env` and `process.env`.

Second, One ensures that all environment variables loaded are only available to the server-side functionality, unless they are prefixed with either `VITE_` (to match Vite convention) or `ONE_PUBLIC_`.

So, for example `ONE_PUBLIC_DAYTIME=false one dev` would set both `process.env.ONE_PUBLIC_DAYTIME` and `import.meta.env.ONE_PUBLIC_DAYTIME` to be the string "false" on both server and client.

But, `SOME_RANDOM_VAR=2` would *not* be exposed to the client side, because it lacks the appropriate prefix.

### Preset environment variables

One also sets some environment variables for you, available on both `process.env` and `import.meta.env`.

- `ONE_CACHE_KEY` is set to a random number for each production build, or once for each development server run. You can use this to have a stable cache key across releases.
- `VITE_ENVIRONMENT` is set to `"client"` for client-side web, `"server"` for server-side web, and `"ios`" or `"android"` for native platforms, respectively.
- `ONE_SERVER_URL` is set in development mode to the current running server URL, like `http://0.0.0.0:8081`. You are expected to set this yourself for production builds.
- `ONE_DEFAULT_RENDER_MODE` is set to either `"ssr"`, `"ssg"`, or `"spa"` based on your [defaultRenderMode setting](/docs/configuration#web-defaultRenderMode)
- `ONE_APP_NAME` is set to your [app.key setting](/docs/configuration#app-key)
- `TAMAGUI_REACT_19` is set to `1`, which turns on Tamagui React 19 mode automatically for you, for performance if using Tamagui.
