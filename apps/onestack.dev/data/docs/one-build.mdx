title: one build
---

Building your app for production happens through `one build`.

It takes the first argument as the platform, which defaults to `web`.

```bash
npx one build [web | ios | android]
```

To build for iOS for example, you would run:

```bash
npx one build ios
```

## Building for web

When building One for web, the output will be a mostly static directory of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Internally, One runs a few different Vite production builds to output client, server, and API folders. This output is always in the `dist` directory.

Ensure your `.env` file has a `ONE_SERVER_URL` set to your production URL, like:

```
ONE_SERVER_URL=https://onestack.dev
```

We provide a production server based on Hono with `one serve` that handles loaders, SSR, and API routes for you. You can choose a deploy target for that server, for now we support `node` and `vercel`. This can be chosen via your Vite configuration:

```tsx fileName=vite.config.ts
import { one } from 'one/vite'

export default {
  plugins: [
    one({
      web: {
        deploy: 'vercel' // defaults to node
      }
    })
  ]
}
```

The CLI will print instructions on how to deploy to the respective platform you choose after you run `npx one build`. You can choose the platform on serve instead, after a successful build:

```bash
npx one serve --platform vercel
```

If you are only using SPA and SSG routes and aren't using loaders, you can statically serve the results of `dist/client` using any server you'd like.

## Building for native

We don't have an end-to-end build command yet, but One is designed to be easy to integrate into existing Expo or React Native build processes.

If you're familiar with EAS, see how to [Build and Deliver Native Apps with EAS](/docs/guides-eas).

Or check out the [iOS Native Guide](/docs/guides-ios-native) for instructions on building your iOS app with Xcode.
