# rn-test-container

This is not a actual app, but a native container for testing that can be used across different test suites.

Since building a native app is time consuming, the goal is to built it once and use it across different test suites.

This app should contain all native dependencies that we need to test.

It can also be used to test if One can prebuild native apps successfully.
